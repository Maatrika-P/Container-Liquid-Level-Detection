# Container Liquid Level Detection 🧪

This repository contains code for detecting and analyzing liquid levels in containers. The goal is to identify variations and errors in the liquid levels and determine if a bottle is accepted or rejected based on being underfilled or overfilled. :heavy_check_mark:


## Features :rocket:

- **Level Detection** :mag_right:: Identify the liquid level by marking a reference line on the bottle.
  
- **ClrL** :droplet:: Separate water from the background and draw the water level.
  
- **Colored Liquid** :art:: Detect the liquid level for colored liquids, calculate the percentage of the empty part, and classify the bottle as accepted, overfilled, or underfilled.


## Getting Started :computer:

1. Clone the repository :arrow_down:.
2. Install the required dependencies :package:.
3. Import the necessary functions :arrow_up:.
4. Load an image of a container 🖼️.
5. Use the functions to detect and analyze the liquid level :gear:.
